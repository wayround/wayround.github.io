                    &nbsp;

                	<div class="blog-post-body">
<p>Not many people have successfully reached the top of Khufu's Great Pyramid since climbing it was banned. Some Russians became an internet sensation for climbing about six months ago. Most other blog posts were written before the recent Egyptian political mess (and subsequent collapse of the tourist industry), and don't accurately reflect the situation on the ground. Climbers report dangerous ascents, recommend sleeping in graves to avoid the park guards, and inform us that the safest place to climb is the South West corner of the Pyramid. Almost all climbers are caught on the way down, but all quickly released after they've paid the necessary "fines".</p>

<p>These rumors are coalescing into a semi-coherent picture of our eventual ascent. Supposedly, the Japanese have pioneered pyramid climbing, and we find an archived blog post that makes reference to a Japanese hostel in Cairo named "Safary". This hostel is supposed to possess a book assembled by climbers that recounts their experiences on the pyramid. My Japanese is passable, so we arrange a room in the hostel (advertised as having free tea and a "manga library"). We hop on our flight from Hargeisa, Somalia, to Cairo, Egypt.</p>

<p>Cairo turns out to be a dirtier version of Beirut. The hostel is correspondingly run-down. But that doesn't matter, we're only here to climb. Within fifteen minutes of checking-in I'm noticing my first mosquito bites. The receptionist, a young quadrilingual Egyptian man (English, Arabic, Mandarin, and Japanese) is polite, but doesn't know anything about pyramid climbing. I try out some of my Japanese, but the other guests are equally naive about pyramid climbing. The manga library lacks any reference to a climbing book, our internet sources are failing, and it seems that we'll be climbing without any local insight.</p>

<p>We catch a few hours of sleep and wake up at around 8AM. We leave our bags (heavy with 14 kilograms of <span>Somaliland Shillings</span>) in the hostel and bring a small day pack filled with jackets and water. The bus takes us to <i>El Giza</i>, and as soon as the bus doors slam shut behind us an assortment of different scammers descend upon us.</p>

<p>Giza is overflowing with scammers, and they seem to come in three flavors: there are the camel-men, who offer you over-priced rides on their domesticated animals, the friendly children who offer you free gifts but then demand payment, and the crooked "cops" who will let you visit restricted parts of the Giza plateau for a price (but I'm foreshadowing--the “cops” only exist inside the park).</p>

<p>Not wanting to pay the $10 entrance fee, Eason and I decide to walk along the perimeter of the fence to try and find a way inside. This method worked well for us when we entered Varosha, and people on the internet report numerous holes in the wall, a product of the slums that ring the plateau.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper toggle-1">
                            <img src="./img/article/post1-image1.jpg" class="image">

                                <p class="description_content">
Giza Map, from Wikipedia. A fence encircles the entire Giza Plateau. The main entrance is to the North. I tried to find in a hole in the fence near the village (indicated in dark yellow) to the East, but failed. My route up the pyramid is in black, and my return route is in red.    
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p style="clear:left;"></p>
     

<p>The great pyramid is looming in the distance as we head for the slums. Every two minutes someone offers me a camel ride or a child tries to press a trinket into my hand. As we head deeper into the slums the number of scammers decreases, and eventually we encounter the wall. Things don't look good. We'd initially hoped to find some nice location to sneak through, giving us the option to return in the night after all the tourists had left, but it looks like the government has beefed up security. The wall is tall and imposing. The bottom half is concrete, the top chain-link. It’s topped off with CCTV cameras and an extra sprinkling of barbed wire.</p>

<p>Giza closes at 4PM, and sundown is at 6, so it looks like we'll need to camp in the park for at least two hours before climbing. We manage to buy cardboard, more water bottles, and some falafel balls. But when we stuff them into our cheap Chinese backpack the seams begin splitting. So we find clear tape and seal the pack shut. Looking rather sketchy, wearing a tiny pink backpack overflowing with cardboard and taped shut, the number of people offering us camel rides dramatically decreases. No more children approach me with trinkets. In this place money can be smelled, and my pungency as a tourist seems to have been temporarily mediated.</p>

<p>We retrace our steps through the slums and enter the park. Collectively $20 poorer, we snap some photos and have a genuine tourist experience. Inside the park you’re forced to wrestle with some uncomfortable thoughts. <i>Why are we doing this? Are we no better than these tourists who don’t know the difference between salaam and salami?</i> Maybe in a few years they'll start selling ad space on the pyramids, and eventually they'll be bulldozed by Disneyland and turned into a theme park. <i>Welcome to Egypt-Land, home of naive fantasies about the Ancient World, $5 soft drinks, and all the pita chips you can eat.</i></p>

<p>But Eason and I didn’t want to think too deeply. It’s important not to be too self-critical when you’re breaking the law.</p>

<p>At the smaller pyramid a guy dressed as a security guard approached us. <i>‘Want to go inside pyramid?’</i> he asked. The man is missing an eye. <i>’He's obviously not a real security guard’</i>, Eason says to me under his breath. But I'm curious about what the man wants to show us, so I follow him down into a maze-like network of graves in the shadow of the pyramid. The area is abandoned, Eason is following behind at a very safe distance, but I'm not particularly worried about my safety--the guy is a head and a half shorter than me.</p>

<p>Down in the labyrinth the security guy begins politely asking for <i>baksheesh</i>. <i>’Baksheesh’</i> is a term used across the Middle East and South Asia to refer to payment for an illicit or semi-illicit service, but I'm saving my bribery for later in the night.</p>

<p>After repeating his request for baksheesh a few more times he's chased away by a guy in a long silvery robe. He introduces himself as <i>‘an important government man’</i> and says that I can climb the (small) pyramid for $50. One scammer has been replaced by another, but I'm a good sport, and before ditching the man I manage to bargain him down to $10. Bargaining is a hobby of mine. He follows me as I walk away from him, but suddenly stops his pursuit when Eason and I turn a corner to another face of the pyramid: actual pyramid guards are lurking on that side, and like a vampire fleeing from the sun, the faux ‘government man’ can't enter their presence.</p>

<p>We wander back towards the great pyramid and enter the graves to the pyramid's west. These are tall walls of stone that have plenty of crannies to hide in. Most climbers find a grave and camp for the night, waiting until well after dark before beginning their journey.</p>

<p>One of the tombs was thrown open, a yawning rectangular opening at the bottom of a depression in the sand, its maw shrouded in shadow. It was like something from an Indiana Jones movie, except that after I walked down to explore, the tomb turned out to be filled with soda bottles instead of snakes. If necessary, we’d hide in there.</p>

<p>We lay down our cardboard between two of the stone walls adjacent to the opening and begin our wait. At about 3:30PM a guy passes by us, and our confidence plunges: we assume that the park must be crawling with guards. We guess that there will be guards patrolling the tombs to chase away stray tourists. However, our fears turn out to be unfounded: 4:00 comes and goes, then 5:00, then 5:30.</p>

<p>Impatience gets the best of us, and we abandon our camping spot to move closer to the pyramid. The sun is sinking below the horizon, and the air is getting cold. We spent another twenty minutes scouting the road that separates the graveyard from the pyramid, but don't see any guards.</p>

Eason Hiding in the Western Cemetery

<p>At around 5:50PM, a few minutes after sundown, we dash across the road to reach the South West corner. There are no guards in sight, and we scramble up the first few blocks. The bottom blocks are larger than the ones further up, and after about ten blocks or so we begin to get into a rhythm. However, our rhythm is quickly broken when we see headlights below us. We both lay prone and watch the headlights approach.</p>

<p>The headlights turn out to actually be a single light, which belongs to motorcycle. The bike parks next to a shack and the rider gets off. He enters the shack, turns on the lights, and begins talking to someone inside. Sound travels really far in the empty desert night. We had passed near the shack on our dash across the road, assuming it to be abandoned, and now we're feeling lucky to not have roused the guard.</p>

<p>More cars travel down the road towards the shack, and two people approach on foot. Either infrared cameras have already observed our presence and these people are assembling to arrest us, or the guards are having a change of shift. Not wanting to abandon our climb, we assume the latter, and wait for the guards to disperse before continuing.

<p>A few blocks up we encounter another problem. In the distance we see that the pyramid of Khafre is illuminated: the light show has begun. If spotlights get pointed at us, our chances of being caught will increase dramatically. We debate our options and the decide to continue the climb. But moments later the spotlights shine on our face of the pyramid. We’re illuminated. We huddle against the face of a stone block and freeze. Tiny spots against the massive and uneven surface of the structure, our chances of being seen by spectators kilometers in the distance is unlikely; however, any guards chancing to look upwards would certainly notice us.</p>

The light show turns our ascent into a game of red-light green-light.

<p>We're engaged in a game of red-light green-light. Our climb pauses whenever headlights pass below us or spotlights illuminate the South West corner.</p>

<p>As we got closer to the pyramid’s apex I could feel the cold desert air on my skin. When I turned my head I could see faint urban lights on the ground below. But I absolutely refused to look down. Even though Eason was a few blocks below me, I couldn’t make myself look down to speak to him--we would only talk during breaks while resting on the same block.</p>

<p>The pyramid rises at an angle of about 45 degrees. 45 degrees doesn’t seem that steep if you look at it on a protractor. But when you’re hugging the side of a pyramid, that’s an angle steep enough to make the horizon vanish below you, creating the illusion of a perpetual vertical drop.</p> 

<p>Even though things got trickier near the summit, I guess the adrenaline let me fight through the fear--I was never paralyzed, like I usually am by heights. </p>

<p>But after an hour I scrambled ungraciously onto the pyramid’s apex like a gravity-defying slinky moving up a flight of stairs. I crawl on my stomach to the center of the pyramid’s flat top. Eason was a few seconds behind me, rising to his feet and making a more dignified victory procession.</p>

<p>As I admired the new bruises that were forming on my arms, I took the chance to admire the graffiti. the pyramid was covered with it, chiseled into every surface. I don’t know how many generations of people had been leaving their mark up here, but I decided to take out my pen and leave a mark of my own.</p>

<p>We paced back and forth. Cairo was like a constellation on the ground, flooding the Nile river valley with yellow light. This is one of the coolest things I've ever done. Right now there are people sipping $20 margaritas on a beach in Florida, screaming at their children for eating too many Skittles from the hotel mini-bar, or pretending that driving through Arizona in an air-conditioned minivan is exotic, and I've just climbed to the top of the world's largest ancient megastructure. It feels fucking great.</p>

<p>We take pictures. After about a half hour we begin the descent. At first it's absolutely terrifying, but Eason  I are both 6'6", so we're able to essentially crab-walk down, rolling our backs against the corner of each block, acquiring even more bruises.</p>

The top. Three wooden beams intersect above me to form faux-crown for the Pyramid. The top of the structure was flattened when marble was looted from the structure's exterior.

<p>The light show still isn't over, and we need to hide for a few more times. Near the bottom we pause to update our plans: we'll wait for the next patrol to pass and then dash back to our previous hiding place in the Western Cemetery. From there we'll walk parallel to the main road until we reach the entrance. Our story will be that we stayed in the park to watch the light show, and Eason takes a number of pictures of the pyramids to corroborate our tale.</p>

<p>Everything goes perfectly. We encounter a few guards on the way out and greet them with <i>salaam aleikums</i>. They smile and wave us through. On the walk back Eason pulls out his cell phone and books us tickets to Athens. The flight departs in five hours. We return to the hostel, brag a little bit, gather our bags, and take a taxi to the airport.</p>
